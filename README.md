# horiseon-project1

Horiseon-project1 is my first independent project for the UC Berkeley extension class.

The main task of the project is to take old code provided by the class for a web optimization marketing website, and factor it to make it easier to read and access for more technical users. The issue in the beginning was that the initial code was almost entirely made up of non-semantic <div> elements, which made correlating sections of code to parts of the website difficult. 
  
Alongside that, the accompanying style.css file also had a number of instances where sections with the same code would repeat themselves, making the file unnecessarily long. 
  
I've gone in and changed the <div> elements to something more semantic to denote a section's purpose (i.e. article, content, aside, etc.).
